# Android App Guide For Non-Android Developers

This is the fastest way to understand how Zest is built if you are not an Android developer. It explains the project shape, the app startup flow, the UI architecture, and the scan pipeline using plain language and diagrams.

## Big Picture

Zest is a native Android app written in Kotlin with Jetpack Compose. Compose means the UI is code, not XML screens. Each screen is a Kotlin function that renders UI from state and sends user actions back through callbacks.

```

## Startup Flow

There are two startup layers:

- Android system splash: shown by the operating system before Compose starts.
- Compose splash: the branded Benevolent Bandwidth and Zest loading screen rendered by app code.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Android as Android OS
    participant Activity as MainActivity
    participant App as UltraProcessedApp
    participant Splash as SplashScreen
    participant Scanner as ScannerScreen

    Android->>Activity: Launch app with splash theme
    Activity->>App: setContent()
    App->>Splash: render branded loading screen
    Splash-->>App: complete after configured duration
    App->>Scanner: show scanner home screen
```

The system splash is configured through:

- `AndroidManifest.xml`
- `res/values/themes.xml`
- `res/values-v31/themes.xml`
- `res/drawable/ic_zest_splash.xml`
- launcher icon resources under `res/mipmap-anydpi*`

The Compose splash is implemented in:

- `ui/SplashScreen.kt`
- `ui/UltraProcessedApp.kt`

## Navigation Model

Zest does not use a large navigation framework yet. The app shell stores a simple destination value and swaps screens with Compose.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Splash
    Splash --> Scanner
    Scanner --> Analyzing: scan label / upload photo / scan barcode
    Scanner --> Settings
    Scanner --> History
    Analyzing --> Results: success
    Analyzing --> AnalysisError: failure
    Results --> Scanner: scan again
    Results --> History
    Settings --> Scanner
    History --> Scanner
    AnalysisError --> Scanner
```

The owner of this flow is `ui/UltraProcessedApp.kt`.

## How Compose Screens Work Here

A screen file usually has three responsibilities:

- Receive state from `UltraProcessedApp`.
- Render UI using project typography, colors, spacing, and shared components.
- Send user actions back through callbacks.

Example mental model:

```text
UltraProcessedApp owns state
        │
        ▼
ScannerScreen renders current state
        │
        ▼
User taps Scan Label
        │
        ▼
ScannerScreen calls onScan(path)
        │
        ▼
UltraProcessedApp moves to Analyzing
```

This keeps screens mostly display-focused and keeps navigation, storage, and provider wiring in one place.

## UI System

The current visual system uses:

- Dark app background.
- Zest green as the primary action and brand color.
- Inter for most UI text.
- Space Grotesk for brand-forward titles and compact labels.
- An 8pt spacing grid for margins and padding.
- A 1.25-ish type scale centralized in `ui/UiTextSizes.kt`.
- Shared brand mark rendering in `ui/AppBrand.kt`.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Theme[Theme.kt] --> Colors[Color.kt]
    Theme --> Type[Type.kt]
    Type --> Fonts[res/font]
    UI[All screens] --> Sizes[UiTextSizes.kt]
    UI --> Brand[AppBrand.kt]
    UI --> Footer[AppFooter.kt]
```

If you change text sizes, colors, or the brand logo, start in these shared files instead of changing one screen at a time.

## Scan Flows

### Ingredient Label Scan

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Tap[Tap Scan Label] --> Capture[CameraX captures image]
    Capture --> File[Saved app-local image path]
    File --> Analyze[FoodAnalysisPipeline.analyzeFromImage]
    Analyze --> Extract[LLM ingredient extraction]
    Extract --> Classify[LLM NOVA classification]
    Extract --> Allergens[LLM allergen detection]
    Classify --> Result[ScanResultUi]
    Allergens --> Result
    Result --> Room[Persist to Room history]
    Result --> UI[ResultsScreen]
```

### Uploaded Photo

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Upload[Tap Upload Photo] --> Picker[Android photo picker]
    Picker --> Copy[Copy selected image into app-local storage]
    Copy --> Analyze[Same image analysis pipeline]
```

### Barcode Scan

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Select[Select Barcode Scan] --> Live[ML Kit live barcode analyzer]
    Live --> Code[UPC/EAN barcode value]
    Code --> USDA[USDA lookup if key exists]
    USDA --> Ingredients[Product ingredient text]
    Ingredients --> Classify[LLM classification and allergens]
    Classify --> History[Persist result]
```

The primary scanner button changes from `Scan Label` to `Scan Barcode` when barcode mode is selected.

## Data And Privacy

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    Secrets[API keys] --> Encrypted[EncryptedSharedPreferences]
    History[Scan results] --> Room[Room database]
    Sound[Sound toggle] --> Prefs[SharedPreferences]
    Images[Captured/imported images] --> Files[App-owned local files]
    LLM[LLM provider] -. only when key is configured .-> Network[Network]
    USDA[USDA] -. barcode lookup only .-> Network
```

Important boundaries:

- API keys are never committed, logged, or shown back in plain text.
- History is local to the device.
- Captured images are local files.
- Sound preferences are local app settings.
- LLM providers receive images or ingredient evidence only when the user has configured a key.
- USDA receives barcode/product lookup requests only when USDA access is configured.

## Build System

Gradle is the Android build tool. Kotlin Symbol Processing, or KSP, is used by Room to generate database code.

Common commands:

```bash
./gradlew :app:verifySourceTreeForBuild
./gradlew :app:compileDebugKotlin
./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug
./gradlew :app:compileReleaseKotlin
./gradlew :app:minifyReleaseWithR8
```

The build includes guard tasks that run before Android builds:

- `verifyNoRetiredSourceFiles` blocks retired demo, legacy, or rule-based classifier files from reappearing.
- `verifyNoDatalessSources` blocks macOS dataless source placeholders that can make Gradle or KSP hang.
- `verifySourceTreeForBuild` runs both checks.

## Safe Change Checklist

Use this checklist before handing a change to someone else:

1. If you changed UI, confirm the screen uses shared typography, colors, spacing, and brand assets.
2. If you added text, put reusable user-facing strings in resources when appropriate.
3. If you added images, fonts, sounds, or icons, keep them under `app/src/main/res`.
4. If you touched analysis contracts, update `documentation/08-llm-api-contracts.md`.
5. If you touched storage fields, update Room migrations and `documentation/06-storage-security.md`.
6. If you touched release behavior, update `documentation/07-testing-release.md`.
7. Run at least `./gradlew :app:verifySourceTreeForBuild :app:compileDebugKotlin`.
